Travelling through buses and trains are not recommended for tourists.If they book a hotel in other boroughs of Mumbai the travelling through cab will take lot of time due to heavy traffic. "

Since, the k-means approach does not make any distinction between one venue to another some venues can outnumber significant venues which are always relatively less. In order to overcome this problem the iterations were done with focused set of venues belonging to either places to visit like museum, aquarium, beaches etc."

I used k-nearest alogirthm to create clusters of Mumbai neighborhoods. These, clusters reveal an important fact that most of touristic spots are within South Mumbai which also has hotels and offers many restaurants with International cuisines. Other boroughs of Mumbai like West, East and North can compete South Mumbai as far as restaurants and shopping is concerned, but no way near South Mumbai for places like Museams, monuments, beaches, boat ride etc is concerned. A hotel in South Mumbai will save lot of time and hassles of commuting through overcrowded trains and buses. \n",
