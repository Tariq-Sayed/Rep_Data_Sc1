Where they can find good restaurants which can offer a wide variety of international cuisine. Or where they can find park and gardens for their small kids.

Other boroughs of Mumbai like West, East and North can compete South Mumbai as far as restaurants and shopping is concerned, but no way near South Mumbai for places like Museams, monuments, beaches, boat ride etc is concerned.
