        "The main data source would be Four Square API which provides the venues along with their categories. But, in order to provide venues of a location you need to provide latitude and longitude of the location. The latitude and longitude of a location are fetched from Geopy library. The Geopy library has some limitations as to number of locations coordinates it can return and times out. This issue was resolved by splitting the data and passing locations in two batches. But major challenge was non-availability of all the neighbourhoods with their respective boroughs. Therefore, constructed this data through Python code using objects like array, dictionary and data frame."
