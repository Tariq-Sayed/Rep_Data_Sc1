Where they can find good restaurants which can offer a wide variety of international cuisine. Or where they can find park and gardens for their small kids. Which areas are good for shopping having  malls or flea markets. Where they can get antiues. The fitness freaks would prefer to have a Gym or Spa nearby. Where they can enjoy a boat ride. The buses and trains usually overcrowded and not recommended for tourists.\n",

        "The foreign tourists will benefit from the findings of this project extremely useful and they can book the hotel in an area where they can find things of their intrest nearby and will save their time in commuting through overcrowded trains or buses. Apart from that those who want to setup a new hotel or a restaurant or some shop for say readymade garments can also be benefitted. Other intrested parties can be tour operators to help them setup their office in right place."
